# example: always copy the contents of the label tag to the composer tag
# (useful for iTunes libraries that don't display the label tag)
tagcopy:
  copy_tags: composer=label

# example: conditionally copy the contents of the label tag to the composer tag
# only when the composer tag is empty
# only_empty_tags applies to all tag copy definitions, you can't apply on a per-tag basis
